bugfixes:
  - >-
    ansible-vault encrypt_string - started appending a line feed at the end of the encrypted string output. Missing newline
    character caused problems identifying where the string ends in some shells (like bash) or accidentally copying an
    extra trailing terminator symbol (e.g., zsh prints out a ``%`` sign to signal where the original output stops)
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78932).
